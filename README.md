Frontend Nanodegree: Project 6 Arcade Game

This is a project in Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.

The project's purpose is to use object oriented JavaScript to create a game similar to Frogger.

How to Play?
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Your player is located on the bottom of the grid layout in the middle.
3. You can control your player's movements by the arrow keys.
4. The bugs running through the screen from left to right are the enemies.
5. You win the game if you move the player to the top of the screen without colliding with any of the enemies.
6. The game ends when you reach the water line.
7. You will have the option to play again. The player automatically to its starting point upon reaching the water, or collision.

For Developers:
1. The index.html file loads the game.
2. The js folder contains app.js with functions. The game loop can be found here too in the engine.js and resources.js files.
3. Styling can be found under css/style.css

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
